## 💡 **Welcome to Generative AI (GenAI)**

**Generative AI** refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can **create** or **generate new content**. This content can be:

* Text (like ChatGPT)
* Images (like DALL·E)
* Music, code, videos, etc.

---

## 🧠 What Does Generative AI Do?

Generative AI **predicts the output** based on input data.
Even if the **input questions are similar**, the **answers can vary** depending on:

* Context
* Randomness
* Training data
* Prompt wording

---

## ✨ Example: ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a popular **Generative AI model** developed by OpenAI.

### How it works:

1. **Pre-training**:
   It is trained on massive amounts of text data from books, websites, and code to understand how human language works.

2. **Fine-tuning**:
   It's fine-tuned to behave helpfully, safely, and informatively for specific tasks (like answering questions, writing code, etc.).

3. **Output Generation**:
   Based on your input (called a *prompt*), ChatGPT will generate a relevant response by predicting the next most likely word/token.

## 🧩 Tokenization

Before processing text, AI models convert it into **tokens**.
A **token** is a unit of text — like a word, part of a word, or even a character depending on the tokenizer.

### Key Points:

* ChatGPT uses a tokenizer to split input into tokens.
* Different platforms (like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude) may use **different tokenization techniques**.
* You can test how text is tokenized using tools like [Tiktokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).

### Example:

```
Text: "ChatGPT is cool"
Tokens: ["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " cool"]
```

## ⚙️ GPT — Generative Pre-trained Transformer

**GPT** is the architecture behind ChatGPT.

* **Generative**: It generates output (like text).
* **Pre-trained**: It is trained on large datasets before being used.
* **Transformer**: The underlying model architecture which enables understanding context better than older models.

---

## 🔁 Why Different Answers for Similar Questions?

GPT models can give different answers because:

* They include **randomness** (called temperature/sampling).
* The **phrasing** of the question matters.
* They consider **context** (previous conversation).
* They are trained to give **natural**, **varied** responses — not always the same robotic reply.
